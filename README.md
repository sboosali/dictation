# `dicto`

My code-by-voice framework (and other dictation-related utilities).

## Speech Recognizers

Only `Dragon NaturallySpeaking` (`DNS`), currently. Uses `natlink`. Supports `Dragon v15` (version fifteen).

## Naming

`dicto` is Latin for "dictate, write down, compose".

"dict-" is (obviously) the root of the word "dictation". So, the name should be more google-able, and more self-documenting, than something arbitrary.
